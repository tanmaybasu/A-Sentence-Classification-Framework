1)  Results: The systematic setup errors were 1.8, 1.6, and 1.1 mm in the manual setup and 0.2, 0.3, and 0.3 mm in
the RTRT setup in right–left, craniocaudal, and AP directions, respectively.

2)  The systematic and random intrafractional
errors were maintained within the ranges of 0.2–0.6 mm and 1.0–2.0 mm, respectively.

3)  The rotational systematic
and random intrafractional errors were estimated to be 2.2–3.2° and 1.5–1.6°, respectively.

4)  The mean discrepancies between
the actual and calculated rotational errors were �0.1 ± 0.5° (mean
� SD) in static phantoms (21).

5)  The systematic errors were 1.8, 1.6, 1.1, and 1.1
mm in the manual setup and 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, and 0.3 mm in the\.

6)  The corresponding random setup errors were
1.4, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.3 mm in the manual setup and 0.5, 0.6,
0.4, and 0.5 mm in the RTRT setup.

7)  The systematic error in rotation was 3.3°, 2.2°, and 2.5°,
respectively, around the RL axis (�), CC axis (�), and AP
axis (�), and the random error was 1.6°, 1.5°, and 1.5°
around each axis, respectively.

8)  The mean � standard deviation of the intrafractional
translational error was �0.1 ± 1.0, �0.3 ± 2.4, �0.5 ± 2.4, and 1.6 ± 3.1 mm in the x, y, z, and 3D directions,
respectively, with frequent modiﬁcation of the patient couch
during delivery of the treatment beam.

12)  (4) reported that the standard
deviation in the setup errors (systematic errors) was 1.7, 1.3,
and 0.9 mm for the RL, CC, and AP directions, respectively,
at the head level and 1.0, 1.0, and 1.6 mm, respectively, at
the neck level.

13)  The random setup error was 0.8–1.4 mm at
the head level and 1.1–1.3 mm at the neck level.

14)  (5) reported that the translational error at the isocenter was
0.74 ± 0.53, 0.75 ± 0.60, and 0.93 ± 0.78 mm in the RL,
CC, and AP directions, respectively.

15)  In that
study, Hong and colleagues (1) concluded that the mean
setup error in any single dimension averaged 3.33 mm and
the mean composite vector offset was 6.97 mm, with a
standard deviation of 3.63 mm.

16)  The random setup error was ap-
proximately 1.5 mm in the manual setup and 0.5 mm in the\.

17)  Using � and
� in Table 2, the appropriate PTV margin was 4.7, 4.1, and
3.2 mm for the manual setup and 0.7, 1.0, and 0.8 for the\.

18)  In the present study, the system-
atic error of intrafractional change of the marker position
was �1 mm, with a random error of 1.0–2.0 mm.

19)  If we use
2� � 0.7� as the appropriate PTV margin, the margin for
intrafractional uncertainty can be calculated at 1.1, 2.4, and
2.5 mm for the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

20)  In total,
when the interfractional translational uncertainty and the
intrafractional translational uncertainty are included, the
appropriate PTV margin would be 5.8, 6.5, and 5.7 mm for
the x, y, and z directions, respectively, in the manual setup.

21)  In the RTRT setup, the margins would be 1.8, 3.4, and 3.3
mm for the x, y, and z directions, respectively—approxi-
mately one- half of those of the manual setup.

24)  The sys-
tematic error was 1.8, 1.7, and 2.0 mm and the random error
was 1.5, 1.1, and 1.6 mm in the RL, CC, and AP directions,
respectively, using these markers  van Asselen et al.
