The relevant sentences are as follow: 

1)  The voxel size of the images ac-
quired using our CT simulator was 1.17 mm � 1.17 mm � 3 mm.

landmark grouping was 1.9 mm and that of the Accuﬁx sys-
tem was 1.2 mm (SD).

placements for the lower landmark grouping for the Type S
and Accuﬁx arms were 5.7 mm and 5.8 mm (SD), respec-
tively.

placement error was 2.9 ± 1.2, 2.9 ± 1.4, 3.6 ± 2.1, 8.8 ± 3.1, 10 � 6.1, 5.1 ± 2.1, 3.1 ± 1.6, and 8.0 ± 4.5 mm at
the odontoid, right styloid, left styloid, C7 spinous process,
right and left acromial extremities, upper landmarks, and
lower landmarks, respectively.

6)  The corresponding popula-
tion mean systematic vector displacement errors for the Ac-
cuﬁx system were 3.0 ± 1.0, 2.6 ± 0.9, 2.7 ± 0.9, 10.2 ± 7.2, 8.0 ± 5.1, 5.7 ± 2.4, 2.8 ± 0.9, and 8.0 ± 5.5 mm\.

7)  S and Accuﬁx immobilization device was 5.2 ± 1.4 min and
5.0 ± 1.1 min, respectively.

8)  Type S device for the upper landmark grouping was 1.9
mm and that of the Accuﬁx system was 1.2 mm (SD).

corresponding total vector displacement for the lower land-
mark grouping for the Type S and Accuﬁx arms was 5.7
mm and 5.8 mm (SD), respectively.

and ML displacements for the upper landmarks in the Type S
arm ranged from 1.7 to 2.5 mm (SD) and those of the Accuﬁx
arm ranged from 1.2 to 2.0 mm (SD).

11)  For the lower bony
landmarks, the total population CC, AP, and ML displace-
ments for the Type S arm were 4.9–6.4 mm (SD) and for
the Accuﬁx arm were 4.6–6.3 mm (SD).

12)  (11) reported setup displacements of 1.3
and 2.2 mm (1 SD) between portal ﬁlms and topograms for
the CC and AP cartesian dimensions, respectively.
