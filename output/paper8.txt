6)  Compared with contour- based regis-
tration, they found a gray- value registration accuracy of 2.4�,
1.6�, and 1.3� (1 SD) for rotation and 0.7, 1.3, and 1.2 mm for
translation in the LR, CC, and AP directions, respectively.

7)  The differences between the expected and measured sys-
tematic errors (Table 5) were within 0.5� and 0.5 mm for
the rotations around the CC and AP axes and the translation
in the LR direction, respectively.

8)  In their data set, the difference between the measured
and expected systematic errors in rotation around the LR, CC,
